# Popular Movies, Stage 1 - Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project

## Waht does this do?
Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow the user to change sort order via a setting:
    The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
    original title
    movie poster image thumbnail
    A plot synopsis
    user rating
    release date

## What I learned
Fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code (picasso)
Hide the API key - I adapted the example code provided here https://medium.com/@abhi007tyagi/storing-api-keys-using-android-ndk-6abb0adcadad
